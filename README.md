# Multi-Layer-Security-Integration-Based-on-SIEM-Solutions
We are launching our minor project, “Multi-Layer Security Integration Based on a SIEM Solution.” It implements defense-in-depth using pfSense, Suricata, and Wazuh, with Kali Linux and OWASP Juice Shop to simulate attacks, detect threats in real time, and analyze incidents through a SOC-oriented SIEM framework.
